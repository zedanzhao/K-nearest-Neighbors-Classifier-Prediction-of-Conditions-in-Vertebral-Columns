# Prediction of Conditions in Vertebral Columns Using Classification Techniques
The biomedical dataset (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/vertebral%2Bcolumn), created by Dr. Henrique da Mota during his medical residency in Lyon, France, includes multiple patients. Each patient is characterized by six biomechanical attributes, reflecting the shape and orientation of their pelvis and lumbar spine: pelvic incidence, pelvic tilt, lumbar lordosis angle, sacral slope, pelvic radius, and the degree of spondylolisthesis. The dataset employs the following labels for classification: Disk Hernia (DH), Spondylolisthesis (SL), Normal (NO), and Abnormal (AB). The task is to perform binary classification, where 'Normal' is coded as 0 and 'Abnormal' as 1, using these biomechanical features.
